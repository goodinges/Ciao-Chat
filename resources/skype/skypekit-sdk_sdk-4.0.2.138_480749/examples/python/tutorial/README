The Python wrapper Reference Manual can be found in the <distroroot>\interfaces\skype\python\documentation directory.

These tutorial examples do not automatically launch the skype runtime. You will need to have a runtime up before running these examples.

NB! You will also need to supply a valid application keypair file name in a separate file, which you can change in keypair.py).
