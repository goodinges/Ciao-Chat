Welcome to the SkypeKit Beta
---------------------------------------------

NB! As of SDK version 3.2, the SDK itself no longer contains SkypeKit runtimes - entire content of the /bin directory is no longer present in the SDK distros. You will now need to trigger and download platform-specific runtime builds separately from the main SDK distribution, from the developer.skype.com website.

  - Kickstart Guides
  - Tutorials 
and more. 

Skype Kit ships with three wrapper libraries:
 C++    - located in interfaces/skype/cpp_embedded
 Python - located in interfaces/skype/python
 Java   - located in interfaces/skype/java

Visit http://developer.skype.com/skypekit/quickstart for instructions on how to build and work with these libraries. 

SkypeKit API Reference Manuals are located in the /documentation direcory of each wrapper library.
  C++    - /interfaces/skype/cpp_embedded/documentation/index.html
  Python - /interfaces/skype/python/documentation/index.html
  Java   - /interfaces/skype/java/documentation/index.html

Example code for wrapper libraries can be found in /examples/<language>/tutorial directories.

NB! You will need to supply a valid key pair to run the examples. To get an application token, visit:
http://developer.skype.com/skypekit/development-guide/general/application-token

The SDK distribution package also contains a SkypeKit-enabled demo application called "skypekitclient." 
Sources for C++ version is located at /interfaces/skype/cpp_embedded/src/client

For more information about the demo client, visit http://developer.skype.com/skypekit

SkypeKit runtimes come pre-built, with the distro package. They are located in the bin/<platform> directory. There is no need (nor is it possible) for you to rebuild these runtimes.

However, if you choose to use the C++ wrapper, you will need to rebuild the library before you can start experimenting with either example projects or command-line demo client (skypekitclient). Project files for rebuilding the C++ wrapper are located in the /interfaces/skype/cpp_embedded/build directory.
